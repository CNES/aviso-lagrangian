Finite Size Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE) is a local lagrangian diagnostics that is widely used for the study of transport and mixing processes of oceanographic tracers (Sea surface temperature, Ocean color ...).
Its computation is derived from the definition of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent that allows the identification of  Lagrangian Coherent Structures.

Given a time series of meso-scale velocity field, this code computes corresponding sub-mesoscale maps of backward FLSE or FTLE. It also compute other diagnostics such as orientation of Finite-Time Lyapunov Vectors.

First steps with the software
======================
[First read the documentation on how to build the library from source and learn to use the software](https://bitbucket.org/fbriol/lagrangian/wiki/INSTALL).
