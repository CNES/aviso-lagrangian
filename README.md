Lagrangian analysis

Introduction
------------

Finite Size Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE) is a local lagrangian diagnostics that is
widely used for the study of transport and mixing processes of oceanographic
tracers (Sea surface temperature, Ocean color ...). Its computation is derived
from the definition of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent that allows the
identification of  Lagrangian Coherent Structures.

The code used to compute LE, was developed in collaboration between LOCEAN (F.
d'Ovidio) and CLS, is available under GNU General Public License

Given a time series of meso-scale velocity field, this code computes
corresponding sub-mesoscale maps of backward or forward FLSE or FTLE. It also
compute other diagnostics such as orientation of Finite-Time Lyapunov Vectors.
