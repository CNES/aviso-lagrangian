Lagrangian Documentation
========================

The **Finite Size Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE)** is a local Lagrangian diagnostic
widely used to study the transport and mixing of oceanographic tracers such as
sea surface temperature and ocean color. It is derived from the **Finite-Time
Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE)**, which helps identify *Lagrangian Coherent
Structures*.

This code, developed in collaboration between LOCEAN (F. d'Ovidio) and CLS, is
released under the GNU General Public License. Given a time series of mesoscale
velocity fields, it computes sub-mesoscale maps of backward or forward
FSLE/FTLE, as well as other diagnostics such as the orientation of Finite-Time
Lyapunov Vectors.
