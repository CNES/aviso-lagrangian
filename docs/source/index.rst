Welcome to lagrangian's documentation!
======================================

Finite Size Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE) is a local lagrangian diagnostics that is
widely used for the study of transport and mixing processes of oceanographic
tracers (Sea surface temperature, Ocean color ...). Its computation is derived
from the definition of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent that allows the
identification of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Given a time series of meso-
scale velocity field, this code computes corresponding sub-mesoscale maps of
backward FLSE or FTLE. It also compute other diagnostics such as orientation
of Finite-Time Lyapunov Vectors.
