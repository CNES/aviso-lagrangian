API Reference
#############

The Lagrangian library provides tools for computing Lagrangian trajectories and
analyzing finite-time Lyapunov exponents from velocity fields. This reference
provides detailed documentation for all public classes and functions.

.. note::

    The API documentation below is generated from the core module, which
    contains the main classes and functions for Lagrangian integration and
    analysis. These classes are implemented in C++ for performance and exposed
    to Python. For convenience, you can import them directly from the root
    ``lagrangian`` module instead of ``lagrangian.core`` in your code examples.
